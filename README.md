# Zookeeper
**Kotlin project - Kotlin Basics - JetBrains Academy**

<ins>***Description***</ins>:
This is a project that could help a zoo look after its denizens by creating a tool for monitoring animals and their status. 

This project could help to understand some Kotlin syntax basics, to learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and with while loops, to learn how to break a loop, and it allows to practice some Kotlin topics like how to read the input, how to use if-else statements, how to use the println function and how to show the expected results.

"There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care. The animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for a large zoo, so one of the zoo employers has suggested a more convenient way to keep track of everything. She wants to be able to pull up a video feed of any animal in the zoo with the help of a program. Being able to check on each habitat would help the zookepers take care of the furry friends more efficiently.

This project allows to create a program that helps the zookepers check on the animals and make sure that they're doing well. The program will be able to process commands from the zookepers and display the animals on a monitor. 

In order to make the project user-friendly, the software should be made ready for the zoo staff to use. The program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work continuously without having to be restarted.

<ins>***Objectives***</ins>:

<ins>***The tasks***</ins>:

The program should show the animal from the habitat entered as input by the user.

An exit opportunity should be included: inputting exit should end the program.

When the program is done running, it should print: See you later!


The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input. 


*The final version of the program should run like this:*
